# pandas-challenge
Pandas DataFrames are created to analyze the district-wide standardized test results.
# PyCity School Analysis
To analyze the district-wide standardized test results, Python and Pandas Dataframes are used. The datasets used for the analysis contains the information of the students’ math and reading scores as well as the schools they attend, along with some other information about the schools. Both the datasets provided are first merged to perform further calculations.

DISTRICT SUMMARY
Following calculations are performed and a DataFrame is created that summarizes the district’s key metrics.
• Total number of unique schools
• Total students
• Total budget
• Average math score
• Average reading score
• % passing math
• %passing reading
• % overall passing

SCORES BY SCHOOL SPENDING
School performance based on the average spending ranges per student. Four bins are created with cutoff values to group school spending. A DataFrame is created with the following metrics.
• Average math score
• Average reading score
• % passing math
• % passing reading
• % overall passing
